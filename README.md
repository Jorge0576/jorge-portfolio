# Jorge Jimenez‑Mejia’s Signiture Work Portfolio

**Problem of Interest:**  
How can the intersection of technology, creative expression, and ethical reflection advance social justice and human dignity in our communities?

**St. Thomas’s Mission:**  
Inspired by the Catholic intellectual tradition, I aim to “think critically, act wisely, and work skillfully to advance the common good.” Each project in this portfolio embodies one or more of the University’s convictions:

- **Pursuit of Truth:** My theology paper on Amos explores historical contexts and modern applications of social justice, engaging in the “unfettered and impartial pursuit of truth.”  
- **Academic Excellence:** My Business Intelligence project leverages rigorous data analysis and machine‑learning techniques to uncover insights that inform more equitable urban policies.  
- **Faith and Reason:** Through theological reflection and technical problem solving alike, I demonstrate how faith and reason can work hand in hand to address contemporary challenges.  
- **Personal Attention:** My Creative Coding project fosters a caring culture by inviting participants to an interactive experience supporting each person’s well‑being through collaborative hands‑on design.
