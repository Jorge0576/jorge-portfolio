# Jorge Jimenez‑Mejia’s Signature Work Portfolio

## Introduction & Problem of Interest

**Problem of Interest:**  
How can the intersection of technology, creative expression, and ethical reflection advance social justice and human dignity in our communities?

**Connection to St. Thomas’s Mission:**  
Inspired by the Catholic intellectual tradition, I aim to “think critically, act wisely, and work skillfully to advance the common good.” Each project in this portfolio embodies one or more of the University’s convictions:

- **Pursuit of Truth:** My theology paper on Amos explores historical contexts and modern applications of social justice—engaging in the “unfettered and impartial pursuit of truth.”  
- **Academic Excellence:** My Business Intelligence capstone leverages rigorous data analysis and machine‑learning techniques to uncover insights that inform more equitable urban policies.  
- **Faith and Reason:** Through theological reflection and technical problem‑solving alike, I demonstrate that faith and reason can work hand in hand to address contemporary challenges.  
- **Dignity & Diversity:** My creative coding project uses interactive media to give voice to underrepresented narratives, respecting the dignity of each participant and celebrating diverse perspectives.  
- **Personal Attention & Gratitude:** I document, in each project section, the iterative feedback and collaborative support that fueled my learning—and give thanks to all mentors and peers along the way.

This portfolio brings together:

1. **Prophetic Ethics in Practice** (Theology & Social Ethics)  
2. **Advanced Business Intelligence Development** (Data Analytics & AI)  
3. **Creative Coding Practices** (Interactive Media & Technology)  

Through these three projects, I illustrate how interdisciplinary inquiry—grounded in St. Thomas’s values—can drive positive change.
