# Jorge Jimenez‑Mejia’s Signature Work Portfolio

**Problem of Interest:**  
How can the intersection of technology, creative expression, and ethical reflection advance social justice and human dignity in our communities?

**St. Thomas’s Mission:**  
Inspired by the Catholic intellectual tradition, I aim to “think critically, act wisely, and work skillfully to advance the common good.” Each project in this portfolio embodies one or more of the University’s convictions:

- **Pursuit of Truth:** My theology paper on Amos explores historical contexts and modern applications of social justice, engaging in the “unfettered and impartial pursuit of truth.”
- **Academic Excellence:** My Business Intelligence project leverages rigorous data analysis and machine‑learning techniques to uncover insights that inform more equitable urban policies.
- **Faith and Reason:** Through theological reflection and technical problem‑solving alike, I demonstrate how faith and reason can work hand in hand to address contemporary challenges.
- **Personal Attention:** My Creative Coding project fosters a caring culture by inviting participants to an interactive experience that supports each person’s well‑being through collaborative, hands‑on design.

## Portfolio Projects

### Prophetic Ethics in Practice  
- **Link:** https://github.com/Jorge0576/prophetic-ethics  
- **Description:** A 12‑page paper analyzing Amos’s call for justice—tracing its ancient context and applying theological and ethical frameworks to contemporary social‑justice challenges.  
- **St. Thomas Convictions:** Faith and Reason; Pursuit of Truth

### Advanced Business Intelligence Development  
- **Link:** https://github.com/Jorge0576/power-bi-project  
- **Description:** Interactive Power BI dashboards driven by Python data‑prep scripts and light machine‑learning models to surface insights on traffic volume, weather, and urban policy.  
- **St. Thomas Convictions:** Academic Excellence; Pursuit of Truth

### Creative Coding Practices  
- **Link:** https://github.com/Jorge0576/creative-coding-project  
- **Description:** The core `sketch.js` implements a real‑time weather‑driven particle system in p5.js. On launch, it prompts for a latitude/longitude, then initializes 3,000 particles whose hue, transparency, stroke weight, speed, and direction all map dynamically to live Weatherstack API data (temperature, cloud cover, UV index, wind speed, and wind direction), with organic flow generated via Perlin noise.  
- **St. Thomas Convictions:** Personal Attention; Diversity

## Synthesis & Conclusion

Through these three projects—Prophetic Ethics in Practice, Advanced Business Intelligence Development, and Creative Coding Practices—I have combined rigorous scholarship, technical expertise, and creative collaboration to advance my Problem of Interest: how technology, creative expression, and ethical reflection can promote social justice and human dignity.

- In the **theology paper**, I engaged Faith and Reason and the Pursuit of Truth to reinterpret ancient calls for justice in a modern setting.  
- In the **BI capstone**, I applied Academic Excellence and the Pursuit of Truth to uncover data‑driven insights for more equitable urban policy.  
- In the **creative coding sketch**, I embodied Personal Attention and Diversity, crafting an interactive experience that centers each participant’s personal curiosity.

Together, these works demonstrate my commitment to St. Thomas’s mission—thinking critically, acting wisely, and working skillfully for the common good—and showcase the interdisciplinary skills I will carry forward in service of a more just and humane world.
